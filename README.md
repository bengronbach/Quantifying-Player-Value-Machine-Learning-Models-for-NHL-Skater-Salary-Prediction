# Quantifying-Player-Value-Machine-Learning-Models-for-NHL-Skater-Salary-Prediction
Valuating NHL 2024 AAVs based off of on-ice data.

NHL teams constantly strive to quantify the dollar value of player performance. In a league maintaining a tight salary cap, contract negotiations are a constant battle between agents trying to secure the highest salary for their players, and teams trying to secure high on-ice production for the lowest possible cost. Kirill Kaprizov secured a record-breaking contract worth 136 million dollars prior to the 2026 season, begging the question, how much is production really worth? 

This experiment will use various machine learning models to predict a player’s Average Annual Value (AAV) based on their raw, on-ice stats. This can be used to determine whether players are undervalued or overvalued, solely based off of their statistics. This metric would be crucial for NHL teams as it would output a quantitative value which can be used in contract negotiations, player scouting, salary cap management, and predicting player trends.  

The data used to train these models is derived from player data from the 2024-2025 NHL season.
